# Memberships

Membership feature provides users with exclusive benefits and privileges that are not available to non-members. Users are typically required to pay a fee to access these benefits, which can be a monthly or yearly subscription.

There are three different membership tiers available: 

- **Silver**
- **Gold** 
- **Diamond**

Each tier offers different benefits and is designed to meet the needs of users with different budgets and usage requirements.

## Silver Membership Tier

The Silver membership tier is the entry-level tier, offering users access to the following benefits:

- (x3) daily, this can be up to 10,000 credits in daily
- 5 reps per day
- Customizable Background (Profile / ID)

:::note
This membership tier is ideal for users who have relatively modest needs and are looking for a cost-effective way to access some of the benefits of membership.
:::

## Gold Membership Tier

The Gold membership tier is the mid-level tier, offering users access to the following benefits:

- (x5) daily, this can be up to 25,000 credits in daily
- 10 reps per day

- (x10) daily, this can be up to 50,000 credits in daily

## Daily on Discord

The Daily feature on our Discord platform allows users to receive a daily credit amount. The amount of credits awarded varies depending on the user's membership tier, as explained in each membership tier description.

## Daily Reps

The Daily Reps feature enables users to give reputation points to their friends through the use of the `/rep` command. These points will be displayed on the friend's profile. 

## Change Background

The Change Background feature provides users with the option to upload their own unique background image for their profile and ID.  

:::note
It's important to note that supported file types are limited to `png`, `jpeg`, and `SVG`, and that images should not exceed `3MB` in size. 
:::

:::warning
Inappropriate backgrounds or content, including `+18` and `NSFW` content, are strictly prohibited. Violation of these guidelines may result in the removal of a user's subscription and their ability to subscribe again.
:::

## Transfer Per Month

The Transfer Per Month feature allows users to transfer their old account data, including their level and credits, once per month. To complete this process, users will be asked to provide their old account ID and email address. It's crucial to note that the email address provided must match the email address associated with the old account. Users will receive a 6-digit authentication code via email to complete the transfer process. 

:::note
It's worth noting that the ability to transfer profile data is only available once per month. This restriction ensures that the transfer process is fair and prevents abuse of the feature.
:::

:::note
It's important to keep in mind that the authentication code is only valid for 15 minutes. If users don't receive a code within that timeframe, they will need to check their email and spam folder or wait for another code.
